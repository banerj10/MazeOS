*An x86-based Operating System written from scratch*

This 'public' branch includes a reduced set of files that is made up of just the OS code that our group wrote for the University of Illinois' Operating Systems class.

Features
--------
- 3 terminals (switch using `Alt-F{1,2,3}`)
- Round-robin scheduling with support for up to 6 concurrent processes
- Custom userspace programs (ELF executable needs to be converted to use)
- 8 syscalls supported (detailed in `include/syscalls/syscalls.h`)
- and more...
